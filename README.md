# Localizations.json

This is global repository for country-specific settings and preferences which are available in [Manager](https://www.manager.io).

## Project structure

Every language has its own folder. For example, English speaking countries are in `English` folder. The Netherlands will be in `Nederlands` folder (Nederlands is native language name).

Within each folder, you will see one or more files in `JSON` format. These are Manager businesses which can be imported into Manager.

This project will combine all JSON files across all countries to produce signular `Localizations.json` which is automatically bundled with the latest version of Manager.
